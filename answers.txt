1. I achieved part two and implemented a hash table for my dictionary attack
I learned about multi threading and tried to use threads to complete multiple
inserts at the same time however it only slowed my program, Therefore I decided
to stick with using only hash tables.

2. For part one I implemented BST and for part two I used hash tables.

3. Both insert and get for the hash map are O(1), however for the large files
in our example with a file over 50000 items insert would be O(50000) which
still simplifies to O(1) but performance is a little slower for larger number
of items.
